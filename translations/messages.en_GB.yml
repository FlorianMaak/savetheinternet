    Upload filters on sites like YouTube, Facebook and the like all have one thing in common: They never act as precisely as a human could. As a result, content is often also removed that violates copyright but is protected by citation law. This "vulnerability" can be used as an excuse to remove content that does not correspond to one's own values and ideas.

Upload blocking in combination with error-prone algorithms ensure that even the posting of links will pose a massive problem in the future. This will be particularly evident on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, 9GAG and Co. In fact, most likely all of your favorite websites. Articles 11 and 13 would ensure that links and direct quotes are blacked out or even prevented entirely from uploading.'

# Graphic box section
graphic_box_title1: 'Article 13 in detail:'
graphic_box_content1: |
    Article 13 requires in practice that almost all internet platforms install a "filter robot" which automatically checks all uploaded content. This unduly restricts freedom of expression before it can be used. Content censorship decision is left to error-prone and oversensitive algorithms (programmed to "play it safe" and erase anything that creates a risk for the platform in case of doubt).
graphic_box_title2: 'Article 11 in detail:'
graphic_box_content2: |
    In ancillary copyright law (Article 11), it is stipulated that the content of certain information providers will in future be subject to specific media law. This means that already quoted texts could be declared a copyright infringement.
    A large part of the providers of news on the net will be affected by this, since the use of external links and links will be restricted or paid.
    This also affects sites like Wikipedia, Stackoverflow and free bloggers.

# Image-split section

    Research and progress are also suffering from Article 11. In the future, users, such as independent researchers, journalists, individuals and various companies, will be denied text and data mining. This has a slowing effect on various discoveries of public interest.
